# DocMachine
DocMachine is a Visual Studio Code extension for generating documentation on the fly.
It uses [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org)-generated parsers to extract parameter names and return types from your code and create formatted function contracts.
The user can customize the format of function contracts and file headers through VSCode settings.
